### 🧮 Example Interaction

**User Query:**
Find (A ∪ B)' when A' = {2, 4, 6} and B = {1, 2, 3} in U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.


**Set Theory Mentor Output:**

Solving for: (A ∪ B)'

Givens:
A' = {2, 4, 6} → A = {1, 3, 5}
B = {1, 2, 3}
U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Steps:
1️⃣ Find A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 5}
2️⃣ Find (A ∪ B)' = U – (A ∪ B) = {4, 6}

✅ Structured Answer:
(A ∪ B)' = {4, 6}

🩺 RCA (if user’s answer was incorrect):
The user misunderstood complement notation. Complement means “elements not in the set,” so the correct result is {4, 6}.

# ⚠️ Limitations – Set Theory Mentor

While **Set Theory Mentor** provides structured and self-correcting learning experiences, several limitations currently exist. These are being addressed in the roadmap.

---

### 🚧 Technical Limitations
| Area | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Scope Restriction** | Responds only to Set Theory and JEE-related concepts. |
| **Visualization** | Cannot generate or interpret Venn diagrams or graphical elements. |
| **Interactivity** | Operates in text-only mode with no persistent learning sessions. |
| **Input Sensitivity** | Works best with clearly defined and complete queries. |
| **Session Tracking** | Does not store or recall user history for privacy reasons. |

---

### 🎓 Pedagogical Limitations
| Area | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Learner Adaptivity** | Currently does not scale question difficulty dynamically. |
| **Motivational Feedback** | Focuses on reasoning accuracy rather than engagement tone. |
| **Prerequisite Knowledge** | Assumes learners have basic math literacy and notation skills. |
| **Emotional Intelligence** | Offers rational, corrective feedback — not affective responses. |

---

### 🧩 Summary
These limitations are intentional design choices to preserve focus, accuracy, and compliance with ethical AI use.  
They also form the foundation for future upgrades such as **adaptive learning**, **visual reasoning**, and **LMS integration**.

# 🧮 Example Interactions – Set Theory Mentor

Illustrative examples of how **Set Theory Mentor** responds to learner queries using its structured reasoning format and Root Cause Analysis (RCA).

---

### 🧠 Example 1 – Conceptual Definition
**User:** *Define Power Set.*

**Mentor:**
> **Definition:**  
> The **Power Set** of a set *A* is the set of all possible subsets of *A*, including the empty set ∅ and *A* itself.  
>  
> **Notation:** P(A)  
> **Example:** If A = {1, 2}, then P(A) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}.

---

### 🧮 Example 2 – Problem Solving
**User:**  
Find (A ∩ B)’ when A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {3, 4, 5, 6}, and U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

**Mentor:**

---

### 📊 Example 3 – Multiple-Choice Question
**User:**  
If n(A) = 3, how many elements are there in the Power Set of A?  
**Choices:**  
a) 3 b) 6 c) 8 d) 9  

**Mentor:**

---

### 💡 Example 4 – Self-RCA (Model Error Simulation)
**User:**  
Find A – B when A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 4}.

**Mentor (Initial Mistake):**
> A – B = {1, 3, 4}

**Mentor (Self-RCA):**
> ❌ Error Detected: Included 4 incorrectly.  
> 🩺 RCA: Element 4 ∉ A, hence cannot appear in A – B.  
> ✅ Correct Answer: A – B = {1, 3}
